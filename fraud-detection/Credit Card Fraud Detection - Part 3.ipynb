In the previous notebook we added pending transactions into the Pending Transaction Container in our Cosmos Database. Here we will read the changefeed and process the pending transactions to check if the transaction is fraudulent based on the vector distance of the transaction embedding compared to the transaction history of the card. If it is fraudulent we update the Credit Card Container to lock the card. If it is not fraudulent then we finally add it to the Transaction Container.\n","\n","### Prerequisites\n","Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n","\n","- A **Cosmos DB artifact** created
