    "# Disaster Recovery: Restore Cosmos DB Data from OneLake Mirrored Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to restore Cosmos DB data in a recovery region by reading mirrored data from OneLake and ingesting it into a recovered Cosmos DB artifact. This is part of a complete disaster recovery strategy using Git integration for artifact configuration and OneLake mirroring for data recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, you'll need to have completed these **disaster recovery preparation steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the Primary Region (Before Disaster):\n",
    "- ✅ **Git integration enabled** for your Workspace and Cosmos DB artifact\n",
    "- ✅ **Cosmos DB mirroring to OneLake** enabled (automatic, RPO < 15 minutes)\n",
    "- ✅ **Lakehouse created** with shortcuts to OneLake mirrored data\n",
    "- ✅ **OneLake shortcut configured** to access mirrored Cosmos DB containers\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the Recovery Region (After Disaster):\n",
    "- ✅ **New Fabric workspace** created in the recovery region\n",
    "- ✅ **Cosmos DB artifact recovered** from Git repository (configuration only, no data)\n",
    "- ✅ **Custom Spark environment** with Cosmos DB Spark Connector libraries\n",
    "- ✅ **Access to OneLake** in the disaster region (automatic replication)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** < 15 minutes (based on OneLake mirroring)  \n",
    "> **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Minutes to hours (depends on data volume)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "1. ✅ Read mirrored Cosmos DB data from OneLake Delta tables\n",
    "2. ✅ Connect to the recovered Cosmos DB artifact in the recovery region\n",
    "3. ✅ Ingest data into recovered containers using ItemOverwrite strategy\n",
    "4. ✅ Process multiple containers in a single execution\n",
    "5. ✅ Provide progress logging and record counts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import This Notebook to Your Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the `ingest-from-mirror.ipynb` file from the repository\n",
    "2. In your **Fabric workspace** (recovery region), select **Import** → **Notebook**\n",
    "3. Upload the downloaded `.ipynb` file\n",
    "4. The notebook will be imported and ready to configure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Configure Your Spark Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you must create a custom Spark environment with the required Cosmos DB libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your workspace, create **+New item** → **Environment**\n",
    "2. Name it (e.g., `CosmosRecoveryEnvironment`)\n",
    "3. Under **Custom libraries**, select **Upload** and add these JAR files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Libraries (Spark 3.5):**\n",
    "- [`azure-cosmos-spark_3-5_2-12-4.41.0.jar`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/azure/cosmos/spark/azure-cosmos-spark_3-5_2-12/4.41.0/)\n",
    "- [`fabric-cosmos-spark-auth_3-1.0.0.jar`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/azure/cosmos/spark/fabric-cosmos-spark-auth_3/1.0.0/)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Publish** the environment\n",
    "5. In this notebook, select **Settings** → **Environment** → Select your custom environment\n",
    "6. Wait for the environment to attach (may take a few minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Gather Required Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the code, collect the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Description | Example |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| **disasterRegionWorkspaceName** | Workspace name where OneLake mirrored data resides | `MyWorkspacePrimary` |\n",
    "| **disasterRegionLakehouseName** | Lakehouse name with shortcuts to mirrored data | `CosmosBackupLakehouse` |\n",
    "| **recoveryRegionCosmosAccountEndpoint** | Cosmos DB endpoint in recovery region | `https://abc123.eastus2.sql.cosmos.fabric.microsoft.com:443/` |\n",
    "| **recoveryRegionCosmosDatabase** | Database name in recovered Cosmos DB artifact | `RecoveredDatabase` |\n",
    "| **containerNamesToRecover** | List of container names to restore | `Seq(\"Products\", \"Orders\", \"Customers\")` |\n",
    "\n",
    "**To find your Cosmos DB endpoint:**\n",
    "1. Open your **recovered Cosmos DB artifact** in the recovery region\n",
    "2. Go to **Settings** → **Account Endpoint**\n",
    "3. Copy the endpoint URL (includes the artifact ID and region)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Update Configuration and Run\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scroll to the **first code cell** below\n",
    "2. Replace all placeholder values with your actual configuration\n",
    "3. Select the **Spark (Scala)** kernel if not already selected\n",
    "4. Run the notebook cells in order\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Consistency\n",
    "- **Schema drift**: If property data types changed over time, OneLake may upcast or store nulls\n",
    "- **Hierarchical data**: Arrays and objects are serialized as JSON strings during mirroring\n",
    "- **Deserialization**: You may need to deserialize JSON strings back to structured types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recovery Strategy\n",
    "- This notebook uses `ItemOverwrite` strategy to handle potential duplicates\n",
    "- Each container is processed sequentially\n",
    "- Progress is logged to help monitor large ingestion operations\n",
    "- Data is persisted in memory to improve write performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Considerations\n",
    "- Large containers may take significant time to process\n",
    "- Monitor Spark executor logs for progress and errors\n",
    "- Consider batching very large datasets if memory constraints occur\n",
